# Sustainable Materials Database Project

Welcome to the Sustainable Materials Database Project!

This project aims to provide a comprehensive database of sustainable materials. It offers two primary installation options:

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Installing the Database
If you wish to install just the database and use your own code to interact with it, follow the instructions provided in the `Installing_the_DB.txt` file located in the "doc" folder. This file includes guidance on setting up the database. Additionally, there's a Flask app container available, allowing you to visualize and interact with the data without needing any further setup.

### 2. Installing the User Interface (UI)
For those interested in installing the User Interface (UI), please install the database using the instructions mentioned above. Once the database is set up, follow the instructions in the `installing_the_GUI.txt` file, also located in the "doc" folder. This will guide you through the installation of the graphical user interface, allowing for a user-friendly way to interact with the data.

Please refer to the respective instruction files for detailed guidance on installation procedures.
