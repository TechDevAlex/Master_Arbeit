The local GUI is being developed using the Python library PyQt6.
##very similar to PySide https://www.pythonguis.com/faq/pyqt6-vs-pyside6/ possibly consider switching to Pyside, APIS 99% the same but PyQt is GPL or commercial license, PySide6 LGPL license##


>src>database
Directory for handling database communication (see files_explained.txt).

>src>search
Directory for handling search-logic (see search_development.txt)

>src>gui
This directory will contain all PyQt6 GUI-related files. The idea is to create a second GUI as a webapp with a completely independent Code-Base.
Unittesting ist handled in >tests>tests_gui

>src>gui>controllers
Directory containing the controllers classes, i.e. the input mechanism of the user interface. controller classses process user inputs and call the apprpriate methods in the model.
##The MVC Model seems to be a common term for GUI development, however it is not at all a consistent term. I have read completely contradictory statements

>src>gui>resources
Contains resources files for the gui like logos as pictures.

>src>gui>screens
##looking for a more intuitive name than screens, windows is possibly confusing because the OS though##
Contains the basic setup for each individual window. 

>src>widgets
##custom or reusable widgets
