assuming the following are installed:
postgres: 15.3
python: 3.11.4

if you have conda installed, activate your environment and install python 3.11.4 inside the environment

navigate to the directory of the requirements.txt file
$ cd .. \Master_Arbeit

install the necessary libraries 

##!!for mac use the requirements_for_mac.txt file, this has not been tested yet!!##
windows: $pip install -r requirements.txt
mac: $pip install -r requirements_for_mac.txt

##a conda env.yml file was the original idea here but pyqt6 is not conda-installable and using pip in conda can result in a broken environment (https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/conda-vs-pip) and it is in general less secure than pip (https://pythonspeed.com/articles/conda-security-scans/)##

pip-install install the local files as a package to enable them to find eachother
for only running the project:
$pip install .
for development: install in editable mode, this allows changes to the source code be immediately reflected without having to reinstall
$pip install -e .

create the database by running 
>init-scripts>init_database.py 

navigate back to the root of the project
$ cd .. \Master_Arbeit

run the Unittests
$python -m unittest discover

if the unittests succeeded:
navigate to the gui folder 
>src>gui
run the welcome_page.py
$python welcome_page.py

if the unittests failed:
"It's not a bug â€“ it's an undocumented feature."


packages used during development but not necessary to run the project:
pylint -> code analysis tool for coding standards
