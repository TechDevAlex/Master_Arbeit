Installing the Database
This setup has only been tested for Windows 10


1. Git

1.1 install git from the offical git website
1.2 Open the Command Prompt (press windows key and search for cmd)
Navigate to the folder you want to clone the project to by using the cd command (current directory) for example: "cd Desktop\Database"
Clone the Database from github, enter "git clone https://github.com/TechDevAlex/Master_Arbeit.git"
if the command git is not recognized, see the guide on the official git website or search for adding git to System PATH variable

2. Docker
	
2.1 Install Docker Desktop for windows from the official Docker website
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
Start the Docker Application and leave it running in the background

2.2 Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory, where the readme file and the Dockerfile are located.
Then run the following command to build the Docker image: 

docker-compose build 

after the container was successfuly built, you can run the application inside the container, enter:

docker-compose up

you can now access the application, open a browser and enter:

localhost:8080

the "users" button is still bugged
